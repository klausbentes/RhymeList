# RhymeList
Simple study project that uses the Datamuse API to fetch and display rhymes for a given word. The script sends an HTTP request, parses the JSON response, sorts the results by word length, and prints them in the terminal. Built to practice API consumption and basic data handling in Python.

This repository is based on a simple study exercise developed as part of an internal project for scholarship students from my cohort at **42 Rio**, focused on **Introduction to APIs**.

Through this exercise, I learned how to consume a public API with Python, handle JSON responses, and organize a small script into a clean, reusable repository structure. This project was created to deepen my understanding of how APIs work and how to consume them properly. The goal is to apply these concepts in the future by building a similar API focused on Portuguese rhymes, handling my own data, endpoints, and responses.
